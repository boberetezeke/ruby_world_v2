# Ruby World

This project is about creating what used to be called a personal information
manager (PIM). In it it would store all of your personal information that
you want to access regularly and allow you to interconnect these pieces of
information into a coherent whole.

## Main Features

* All pieces of your personal data are treated as objects that can 
  be manipulated with Ruby
* All these pieces of personal data are tracked to keep track of changes 
  to all objects and their relationships
* It relies on context so that when data is created it can assume
  the context in creating the object and applying context to the
  new object so that it fits within the context
* It allows syncing with external data sources so that changes in the
  world can be kept in sync with the person's personal data
